This script shows an initial attempt to post-process the CICE5 history files from
tripole to rectilinear grids. It currently does not give correct results because
I am pointing to an old remap file.  

It can be run by just giving the directory where the history files reside, for
example: 

ncl < postice.ncl 'dirname="/scratch3/NCEPDEV/stmp1/Denise.Worthen/Benchtest/"'

The script will loop over all files in that directory starting with the name "ice".
The files will then be written to a subdirectory of dirname (called in this case
"024") to indicate they are regridded to 1/4 degree; "024" is also appended to the
filename

ESMF regridding:

The script make_cice5regrid.x will create a little script to use ESMF Regrdding to
generate the remapping file. Usage:

module load esmf/7.0.2
make_cice5regrid.x>regrid.x 
chmod +x regrid.x
./regrid.x

You should end up with a file called cice5_tripole_tgrid_rect024.nc which can be
used in the icepost script
